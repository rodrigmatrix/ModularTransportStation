## Modular Transport Station [Previously Subway Freedom]
Create unlimited entrances and platforms with different depths for Subway, Trains, and Trams.

## How to use it:

You can watch the linked YouTube video to understand how it works or read bellow.

- 1 Create a Station Module: Go to the Subway tab and place the Station Module asset on the side of a street. You will need that to add more upgrades. It also acts as an invisible entrance so pedestrians will be spawning on it.

- 2 Place a platform: You can choose the elevation level and line type and if it's strait or curved. Use anarchy and disable snapping to place anywhere you want. You can add as many as you want.

- 3 Place an entrance: To the passengers to have access, place and entrance on the side of a road or connect invisible pedestrian paths to it. You can have as many as you want.

- 4 Connect the stops to the platforms and see the magic.

- 5 To delete/move the module and/or upgrades, click on an entrance, go to the main module building, and delete all of its sub-building on the info panel or use the bulldozer on the module or sub-buildings. You can also click any sub-building and go to the main building to check all the upgrades.

# KNOWN ISSUES:
- If you have the mod ExtraDetailingTools, you will see a button to delete the subway module on the info panel. Do not use that button to delete the module and all sub-buildings.
Instead, you can first delete the upgrades or use the bulldozer on the subway module to delete everything for that station.
You can delete other upgrades from the info view but not the subway module. This issue causes surfaces and platforms not being deleted.
This also happens to other buildings and is caused by the ExtraDetailingTools delete button.

- This is not an issue but something from the move it mod. If you need to move entrances or platforms, you'll have to click on them and use the reallocate button. This happens for other in game building as well so there's no fix for it so we need to wait for move it to support sub-buildings.

## For asset creators:
- If you want to create a custom entrance and make it compatible with this mod, you can do so by creating a building and adding a ServiceUpgrade with the id: "CID:e902134afd93ed423222ac225e8eebd1". You can check the entrances present here for examples.
